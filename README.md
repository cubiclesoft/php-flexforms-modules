Features
--------

* Officially supported modules for FlexForms.
* Modules have a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Designed for relatively painless integration into your project.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.

Available Modules
-----------------

* Calendar - Adds a new field type (calendar) that replaces the input array with a set of standard FlexForms tables to display a calendar.
* Chart - Adds a new field type (chart) that displays a variety of [C3.js charts](http://c3js.org/).
* File Uploader - Adds new options to the 'file' field type to display a fancy file uploader that supports drag-and-drop, previews, client-side file naming, chunked uploads, and more.
* HTML Editor - Adds new options to the 'textarea' field type to convert a textarea into a TinyMCE HTML editor.  Filtering content submitted to the server for cross-site scripting (XSS) injection attempts is up to the developer, but using [TagFilter](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper) is highly recommended.
* Preview URL - Adds new options to all field types to show a preview dialog on click for supported MIME types.  Can preview images, audio, video, and 'iframe' content.  Applied to elements that have a 'data-preview-type' attribute which specifies the MIME type.
* Stop Password Manager - Adds a new option to the 'password' field type that can be used to stop password managers from attempting to store entered passwords.
* reCAPTCHA - Adds a new field type (recaptcha) that displays and can validate [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).
* Table Filter - Adds new options to the 'table' field type to display a search field at the top of the table to quickly find matching rows more efficiently than built-in browser searching.
* Text Counter - Adds new options to the 'text' and 'textarea' field types to display a counter that shows the number of characters (or words) entered.

Usage
-----

Copy all the files for a specific module into the same directory that FlexForms resides in (e.g. `support/flex_forms.php`).  Then use `require_once` directives to include the required functionality after including FlexForms.  Modules register themselves automatically with the FlexForms class.

The following new field types are added:

* calendar (via Calendar) - Replaces the input with one or more standard FlexForms tables to display a calendar.
* chart (via Chart) - Displays [C3.js charts](http://c3js.org/).
* recaptcha (via reCAPTCHA) - Displays a [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).

New type-specific options for array fields:

* startyear (calendar) - An integer containing the starting year (inclusive) (Default is date("Y")).
* startmonth (calendar) - An integer containing the starting month (inclusive) (Default is date("m")).
* endyear (calendar) - An integer containing the ending year (inclusive) (Default is date("Y")).
* endmonth (calendar) - An integer containing the ending month (inclusive) (Default is date("m")).

Examples
--------

Example code showing how to use most modules can be found in the Admin Pack [admin.php file](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/admin-pack/blob/master/admin.php).

reCAPTCHA Module Example
------------------------

Since it doesn't really belong in Admin Pack, here's a brief example of using the reCAPTCHA module:

```php
<?php
	// This example is derived from:
	//   https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-flexforms/blob/master/docs/flex_forms.md

	require_once "support/str_basics.php";
	require_once "support/flex_forms.php";
	require_once "support/flex_forms_recaptcha.php";

	// ...

	$errors = array();
	if (isset($_REQUEST[$ff->GetHashedFieldName("name")]))
	{
		// ...

		$result = FlexForms_reCAPTCHA::IsValid("[Your secret key goes here]");
		if (!$result["success"])  $errors["recaptcha"] = $result["error"] . " (" . $result["errorcode"] . ")";

		if (!count($errors))
		{
			// ...
		}
	}

	// ...

	// Make your own site and secret key:  https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

	$contentopts = array(
		"hashnames" => true,
		"fields" => array(
			// ...
			array(
				"title" => "Module:  Invisible reCAPTCHA",
				"type" => "recaptcha",
				"name" => "recaptcha",
				"sitekey" => "[Your site key here]",
				"size" => "invisible",
				"desc" => "Description for reCAPTCHA."
			)
		),
		"submit" => "Submit"
	);

	$ff->Generate($contentopts, $errors);
?>
```

Even though the 'recaptcha' name attribute is not output, it is used for displaying error messages regarding reCAPTCHA submissions.

FlexForms_reCAPTCHA::IsValid($secretkey, $remoteip = true, $allowedhosts = true)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module:  reCAPTCHA

Access:  public static

Parameters:

* $secretkey - A string containing a [secret key](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).
* $remoteip - A boolean that determines whether or not to pass the remote IP address of the client to reCAPTCHA or a string or IPAddr compatible array containing a specific IP address to pass (Default is true).
* $allowedhosts - A boolean to allow all hosts or a string or an array to only allow specific hosts to be valid (Default is true).

Returns:  A standard array of information.

This function sends the reCAPTCHA code in $_REQUEST["g-recaptcha-response"] to the Google reCAPTCHA verification server.  The included HTTP, WebBrowser, and IPAddr classes are loaded as needed.  The defaults are generally good enough but customizations of the sitekey/secretkey (e.g. removing domain restrictions, proxying requests) may require calling this function with corrected options for `$remoteip` and `$allowedhosts` to guarantee that the CAPTCHA was solved by a valid IP address and hostname.
